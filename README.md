# Churn-Risk-Analysis-with-RFM

## Overview
In this project I used RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation and to identify customers at risk of churning. By analyzing customer purchase behavior, I was able to segment customers, uncover demographic insights, and develop strategies to re-engage those at risk of churn, ultimately aiming to enhance customer retention and drive business growth.

## Methodology
